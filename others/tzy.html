           and respected for always showing love to his people and promoting young artist, as he has once again
           proving his love to this up-coming artist as he signs lil humble, a very talented kid who started his
            dream as an artist in school, singing for his friends. He caught the attention of TZY from the song/rap

            and of course hisdream came through as TZY just signed him.
